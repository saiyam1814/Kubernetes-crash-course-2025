# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Create core MemoryGame component structure
  - Create `frontend/src/components/MemoryGame.js` with basic React functional component
  - Import required dependencies (React hooks, axios, logo asset)
  - Set up initial component structure with consistent styling patterns from existing games
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.1, 4.3_

- [ ] 2. Implement game state management and data models
  - Define game configuration constants (grid size, card symbols, timing)
  - Initialize state variables for cards, flipped cards, matched pairs, moves, and game status
  - Create card object structure with id, symbol, isFlipped, and isMatched properties
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3_

- [ ] 3. Implement card grid generation and shuffling logic
  - Write function to generate pairs of cards with emoji symbols
  - Implement Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm for card randomization
  - Create function to initialize new game with shuffled card deck
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 4. Build card flip mechanics and interaction handling
  - Implement `handleCardClick` function with flip logic and validation
  - Add logic to prevent flipping already matched or currently flipped cards
  - Create card flip state management with proper timing controls
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 5. Implement matching logic and game progression
  - Write `checkForMatch` function to compare two flipped cards
  - Add logic to handle matched pairs and update game state
  - Implement move counter increment on each card selection
  - Create game completion detection when all pairs are matched
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.4_

- [ ] 6. Create game UI components and styling
  - Build responsive card grid layout using Tailwind CSS classes
  - Style individual cards with flip animations and hover effects
  - Add game status display (moves counter, completion message)
  - Implement consistent styling with existing games (colors, fonts, spacing)
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.3_

- [ ] 7. Add game controls and reset functionality
  - Implement `resetGame` function to reinitialize game state
  - Create start/reset button with consistent styling
  - Add game completion celebration UI with win message
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 4.2_

- [ ] 8. Integrate JWT authentication and backend communication
  - Add JWT token retrieval from localStorage following existing pattern
  - Implement `updateGameStats` function to send statistics to backend
  - Use existing `/api/game/game/stats` endpoint with 'memory-game' game type
  - Add error handling for API calls with console logging
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 9. Add responsive design and mobile optimization
  - Implement responsive grid that adapts to different screen sizes
  - Ensure touch-friendly card sizes for mobile devices
  - Test and optimize animations for mobile performance
  - Add viewport meta considerations for mobile rendering
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.3_

- [ ] 10. Update Dashboard component integration
  - Add Memory Game link to dashboard games navigation section
  - Update dashboard styling to accommodate new game option
  - Ensure consistent link styling and hover effects
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 11. Extend backend API to support memory game statistics
  - Update game-service `/users/scores` endpoint to include memory game stats
  - Modify database query to fetch memory game wins/losses from games_stats table
  - Update response JSON structure to include memory_game_wins and memory_game_losses
  - Test existing `/game/stats` endpoint with 'memory-game' game type
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 12. Update App.js routing configuration
  - Add new route for `/memory-game` path in App.js Switch component
  - Import MemoryGame component at top of App.js
  - Wrap route with PrivateRoute component for authentication protection
  - Test routing navigation to and from memory game
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [ ] 13. Implement comprehensive error handling
  - Add try-catch blocks around API calls with proper error logging
  - Implement validation for card click events and game state transitions
  - Add fallback UI states for error conditions
  - Test error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 5.4_

- [ ] 14. Add performance optimizations and accessibility
  - Implement React.memo for card components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
  - Optimize animation performance using CSS transforms
  - Test performance with extended gameplay sessions
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.4_

- [ ] 15. Create comprehensive test suite
  - Write unit tests for core game logic (card flipping, matching, win detection)
  - Test component rendering with different game states
  - Add integration tests for API communication and authentication
  - Test responsive behavior across different viewport sizes
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 5.3_
